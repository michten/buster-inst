# buster-inst
> Collection of simple bash scripts with configuration of my debian-desktop setup.

## General info
Script are in bash.
There are probably better tools to use for this, but I wanted to write something in bash and it was my main purpose.
Scripts are idempotent or will exit when some conditions weren't meet and make backups of config files.

## Setup
Need root permission.
Before execute, READ THEM.
Make sure that your working directiory is a dir where are all the files.
